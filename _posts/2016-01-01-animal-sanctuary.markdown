### Animal Sanctuary in Dorney
Animals all over the country are suffering dreadfully due to the recession, hundreds are dying needlessly each week and are left neglected and uncared for. 

Quite often they are dumped or left to die in appalling conditions. The Animal Sanctuary UK has a NO KILL policy so all animals we rescue or are surrendered to the sanctuary are re-homed or stay with us for their life. This policy includes accepting former sanctuary animals back if their owners discard them. They also actively promote organic, fair trade & a cruelty free lifestyle. The animal sanctuary receive no government or lottery funding and rely totally on the generosity of supporters to help with animal care and to rescue animals and re-home where possible.
 
It costs the sanctuary around Â£1500 in feeding the animals in addition to vet costs. You can either donate money to help or if you are like me and not earning money, can volunteer and help with animal care, fund raising, colletions at local stores and events. If you wish to help, please visit their [website](http://theanimalsanctuaryuk.org.uk) for more details.
