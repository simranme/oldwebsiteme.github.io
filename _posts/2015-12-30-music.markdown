### What do you get of you cross a cello/sarangi and a sitar?
The answer is... a Diruba! 

The Dilruba was produced to replace the previously heavy instrument **the Taus**. This attempt was intended to *scale down* the Taus into what is now known to be the Dilruba. Like the cello or sarangi, it is played with a bow *known as a* **gaz**, with the other hand moving along the strings above the frets (similar to the sitar). The player may slide the note up or down to achieve the portamento, or meend, characteristic of Indian music.

Both the dilruba and the esraj had been declining in popularity for many decades. By the 1980s the instrument was nearly extinct.
The dilruba has somewhat pleasanter and more delicate tone than the sarangi. The playing strings are tuned Sa Pa Sa Ma (C, G, C, F). The dilruba has been mostly popular in U.P., Delhi and Punjab region. It has not had many votaries and there are not many famous dilruba players. Pyara Singh Martand, a staff artist of All India Radio was a distinguished dilruba player in his own right and popularized the instrument to some extent by his solo broadcast performances during the 1940s-1950s. Om Prakash Sharma of Delhi is another dilruba player of distinction who also plays the esraj.
Ravi Shankar (known then as Rabindra) played the Dilruba in the 1930s, as a member of the dance group of his older brother Uday Shankar.
It is also one of the instruments frequently used by Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman, who wrote the soundtrack for **Slumdog Millionaire.**
